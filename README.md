# Tuner

**Tuner** is a lightweight desktop widget built in **Rust** using **raylib** that displays the currently playing Spotify track on Linux. It shows album art, song title, artist, an animated equalizer, and supports dark/light themes.

The application polls Spotify metadata via `playerctl` and renders a minimal, modern UI with smooth updates.

## Notes & Limitations

* Linux-only (depends on `playerctl`)
* Spotify desktop client required
* Album art is downloaded to a temporary file and cleaned up automatically
* Text is truncated (UTF-8 safe) rather than wrapped
* No tray icon or background mode (yet)
* No support for non-Spotify players (yet)
* No support for non-Linux platforms (yet)
* The C# version works but is not actively maintained and not recommended for use.
---

## Future Improvements

Planned or possible enhancements:

* Text wrapping and scrolling titles
* DPI-aware scaling
* Tray mode / always-on-top
* Support for non-Spotify players
* Windows/macOS support (alternative metadata backend)
